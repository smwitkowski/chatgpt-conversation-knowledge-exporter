## Canonical snapshot (current truth)

- **Exam scope:** **Google Professional Machine Learning Engineer (PMLE)** only.  
  <!-- source: steering-confirmation, 2025-12-24 -->
- **Offer:** **One plan — $15/month**.  
  <!-- source: steering-confirmation, 2025-12-24 -->
- **Risk reversal:** **Pass-or-Extend** is the intended guarantee concept (operational + copy TBD).  
  <!-- source: steering-confirmation, 2025-12-24 -->
- **Positioning boundary:** Do **not** imply official endorsement or claim unverified outcomes (pass rates, ratings, confidence deltas).

## Primary ICP (launch focus)

### Summary
**Individual professionals** preparing for the PMLE who want a realistic readiness signal + efficient study plan, and who typically pay out-of-pocket.  
<!-- source: 6803d6a2-9950-8005-ad25-816de069e880, 0a19ae9f-edf6-41d5-989a-d940b99ab9be -->

### Key traits (editorial synthesis)
- Already working in (or moving toward) **ML/data/cloud** roles
- Time-constrained (studying nights/weekends)
- Wants to avoid “random studying” and instead focus on the few things that move their score
- Values **explanations** and “why” over sheer volume of questions  
  <!-- source: 6803d6a2-9950-8005-ad25-816de069e880, 1e805ad7-72a2-448b-af59-223d412e6180 -->
<!-- source: editorial-synthesis, 2025-12-24 -->

### Best-fit trigger moments (editorial synthesis)
- Exam date is scheduled (or imminent)
- Promotion / job change requiring a credential
- Prior failure or “I don’t know what I don’t know” anxiety
- Dissatisfaction with static question banks (“I don’t trust the explanations / realism”)  
<!-- source: editorial-synthesis, 2025-12-24 -->

## User jobs-to-be-done (JTBD)

### Core job
> “Help me get to *real exam readiness* quickly, and show me exactly what to study next.”

- Need: **realistic** practice questions and full practice exams  
  <!-- source: 6803d6a2-9950-8005-ad25-816de069e880, 0a19ae9f-edf6-41d5-989a-d940b99ab9be -->
- Need: **high-quality explanations** (teaching value, not just answer keys)  
  <!-- source: 6803d6a2-9950-8005-ad25-816de069e880, 1e805ad7-72a2-448b-af59-223d412e6180 -->
- Need: **personalized study planning** based on performance  
  <!-- source: 6803d6a2-9950-8005-ad25-816de069e880, 0a19ae9f-edf6-41d5-989a-d940b99ab9be -->
- Need: content that stays aligned as **blueprints change**  
  <!-- source: 6803d6a2-9950-8005-ad25-816de069e880, 0a19ae9f-edf6-41d5-989a-d940b99ab9be -->

### Success criteria (as the user experiences it)
- “I know what to study next” (clarity)
- “I’m improving in weak domains” (progress)
- “I’m confident I can pass” (readiness signal)
- “The explanations are trustworthy” (quality bar)

## Primary pains & objections

### Pains
- Static question banks feel shallow, repetitive, or misaligned
- Studying without a plan creates overwhelm / uncertainty
- Users don’t know which blueprint areas they’re weak in
- Fear that exam content has shifted since older prep material was created  
  <!-- source: 6917f618-6938-8326-bb36-43e7419affbe, bd5b2146-576c-4d28-9b7e-43d1fe72d55d -->

### Objections (and how Testero should respond)
- **“Are these questions realistic?”** → quality rubric + explanation quality + continuous QC loop  
  <!-- source: 69388fc5-f5a8-8325-92b4-cb90096da1c7, de01a96f-53e9-48c9-97c5-8e394fd15587 -->
- **“Is this officially endorsed?”** → clearly state “independent prep tool”  
  <!-- source: 693c3ff6-2c18-832e-a7d6-d48ce7fd5164, 67f0c06a-a10b-4e44-a2ee-9226a6c23c18 -->
- **“Do you guarantee I’ll pass?”** → Pass-or-Extend (but only once operationally defined)  
  <!-- source: steering-confirmation, 2025-12-24 -->
- **“Why pay when there are free resources?”** → emphasize personalization + readiness signal + efficient plan  
  <!-- source: editorial-synthesis, 2025-12-24 -->

## Secondary ICPs (future)

### Teams / orgs (B2B / B2B2C)
Organizations (consulting firms, engineering teams) that want to:
- Upskill cohorts
- Track progress over time
- Get reporting/visibility for managers  
<!-- source: 6803d6a2-9950-8005-ad25-816de069e880, 0a19ae9f-edf6-41d5-989a-d940b99ab9be -->

**Status:** future direction; do not let enterprise needs distort the early B2C learning loop.  
<!-- source: 693c3ff6-2c18-832e-a7d6-d48ce7fd5164, 8454d34a-68b4-4d29-a6b8-139318a9a6cb -->

## Positioning boundaries (non-negotiables)

- No “official endorsement” implication  
  <!-- source: 693c3ff6-2c18-832e-a7d6-d48ce7fd5164, 67f0c06a-a10b-4e44-a2ee-9226a6c23c18 -->
- Avoid unverified claims (pass rates, confidence deltas, ratings) until data exists  
  <!-- source: 693c3ff6-2c18-832e-a7d6-d48ce7fd5164, 67f0c06a-a10b-4e44-a2ee-9226a6c23c18 -->
- Keep scope narrow: PMLE-first; additional certs are expansion milestones  
  <!-- source: steering-confirmation, 2025-12-24 -->

## Open questions (to resolve later)

1. **Activation definition:** What exact behavior qualifies as “activated learner” (WAU vs WAL definition)?  
   <!-- source: 6918039f-21f8-832a-b8ad-6950cec4c3d1, 3a6d2c5c-4425-4a1b-8f88-9a7d8a8e1b1d -->
2. **Pass-or-Extend criteria:** What counts as “followed the plan” and how is outcome verified?  
   <!-- source: steering-confirmation, 2025-12-24 -->
3. **Free vs paid boundary:** What minimum free experience is required to demonstrate value before the paywall?  
   <!-- source: 693c3ff6-2c18-832e-a7d6-d48ce7fd5164, 1e3a16a0-d0b9-4ee3-b7b0-12ddb697d87f -->
